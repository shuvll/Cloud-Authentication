# Overview

My software interacts with the database by allowing the user to sign into their google account. Afterwards the user will be able to send messages into a chat.

The purpose behind this idea is to create a chat that can be accessed if you sign into a google account. I wanted to make a chat that I could use, but I also wanted to implement some authentication in the mix.

# Cloud Database

For this project, I used Google Firebase. I used it because there was linked help in the moduals, and seemed the easiest to understand and use.

The majority of my work was in App.css and App.js. The other files were taken care of by React App, which set up 'cloudauthentication.'

# Development Environment

I used Javascript primarily, along with some CSS for the main part. I used these languages in combination with Firebase, Firestore, Node, and React App.
